# Titanic Survival Prediction using Decision Trees

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook where I explore and analyze the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal of this project is to use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets used in the field of data science and machine learning. It contains data of the passengers aboard the ill-fated luxury liner that sank on its maiden voyage. This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the survival outcome of passengers.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter notebook, `Decision_Tree_Classifier_Titanic.ipynb`, includes the following sections:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection
- Model building using a Decision Tree Classifier
- Model evaluation and validation
- Confusion matrix visualization

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
